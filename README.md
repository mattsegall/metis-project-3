# **Automating Genre Labeling With Classification Models**

by Matt Segall

### Overview

As a former professional musician, I've spent a lot of time thinking about what makes music "belong" to a certain genre. Musicians are known to argue tirelessly about subgenre, and perhaps give up entirely and declare genre a meaningless construct. Can a machine learning model learn to distinguish between musical genres? This philosophical inspiration led me to a more pratical problem of automatic the genre assignment process for new music submitted to Spotify's platform. 

### Data

I began with a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mrmorj/dataset-of-songs-in-spotify?select=genres_v2.csv) I found on Kaggle, of 50,000 songs pulled from Spotify's API over 15 different genres. That data set proved to be less succesful (more on that later), so I pulled a custom dataset through the API myself, with about 8,000 songs over eight genres.

### Process

I began building simple, out of the box models with most of the classifieds we were taught, and did not get great results. After digging into the data bit more, I concluded that the genres might be too similar for a basic protoype - dark trap and trap metal; techhouse and techno; trance and psytrance. There was very little variation in the features between genres. So how could I expect the model to distinguish a songâ€™s genre? 

 Instead of splitting hairs, I wanted to start off working with a dataset that contained much more easily differetiable genres. So, I went back and pulled a custom data set through our API of genres classical, country, electronic, hiphop, jazz, latin, pop and rock. These are certainly more major and distinct genres.

Now that I was feeling more confident in my dataset, I went forward with model selection, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning.

### Results

 Ultimately, an out of the box random forest model on my original features performed nearly as well as a tuned version with polynomial-transformed features, both achieving accuracies near 80%.
